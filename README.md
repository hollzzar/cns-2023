# CNS 2023 poster

I will present this poster at the [30th Anniversary Meeting of the Cognitive Neuroscience Society](https://www.cogneurosociety.org/) in San Francisco, California.

Listeners use social context to adapt to variation in speech. Despite this adaptability in speech perception, research with mono-dialectal speakers of Mainstream US English (MUSE) has demonstrated a consistent advantage for within-dialect (D1-D1) communication over cross-dialect (D1-D2) communication in terms of accuracy, speed, and cognitive effort. However, since bi-dialectal speakers with substantial exposure to more than one dialect are understudied. it is unclear whether the within-dialect advantage is due to production experience, comprehension experience, perceptions of prestige, or a combination of these factors. To investigate the mechanisms that underlie bi-dialectal speech perception, we are conducting a series of auditory EEG/ERP experiments with mono-dialectal MUSE participants and bi-dialectal Southern US English (SUSE) participants that differ in the predictability of the upcoming accent. In the first experiment presented here, we established an unpredictable dialect context by presenting auditory stimuli in MUSE and SUSE accents in random order. Mono-dialectal MUSE participants performed a cover task while they listened to real words and pseudowords in both accents. Results indicate that phonetic and lexico-semantic access are disrupted in D1-D2 communication. Between 150-300ms, MUSE real words elicited larger P200 effects than SUSE real words, reflecting less effortful phonetic access for the D1 accent. Between 300-500ms, SUSE tokens elicited stronger N400 effects than MUSE tokens, reflecting more effortful lexico-semantic access for the D2 accent, regardless of word type. These findings contribute to the linguistic diversification of traditional speech perception models and set the stage for future experiments that manipulate socio-indexical factors and accent predictability.
